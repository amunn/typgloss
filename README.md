# typgloss

The typgloss LaTeX package aims at simplifying the **typ**esetting of grammatical **gloss**es and syntactic annotations in interlinear glossed examples.

The package will recognize strings of uppercase letters in interlinear glossed examples as grammatical labels and automatically typeset them in small caps. It can be used together with the leipzig package to prepare a list of grammatical abbreviations. It also solves the problem of correctly aligning glossed examples that include syntactic brackets and annotations.

The package depends on the expl3 and xpatch packages and can be used with either gb4e or langsci-gb4e. Further testing is needed with linguex. It is untested with expex.

There is no full documentation at the moment, but detailed instructions and usage examples can be found here:

The package is still experimental and needs to be thoroughly tested. Feedback is thus highly welcome.
